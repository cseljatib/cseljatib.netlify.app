I am a Full Professor of Biometrics at the [Centre of Ecosystem Modelling and Monitoring (CEM)](https://www.cem.umayor.cl/) at the [Universidad Mayor](https://www.umayor.cl/), in Santiago, Chile. His research interests include biometrics, applied statistics and ecological modelling. I lead the Biometrics group, which develops mathematical and statistical models for forecasting forest ecosystem features, allometry, and sampling.
